Perfect ‚Äî let's expand the dialog generator with **more templates** across different tones and scenarios: **trading**, **flirting**, **fighting**, and **fooling around**.

Each category below includes:

* üé≠ **Template examples**
* üé≤ **Word banks / variable slots**
* üß† Optional logic hints for personality or context

---

## üè™ 1. **Trading / Merchant Talk**

### üé≠ Templates

```text
- "Looking to trade, [player_title]? I've got the finest [item_type] this side of [region]."
- "Gold or goods, it‚Äôs all the same to me. What‚Äôs your offer?"
- "Don‚Äôt waste my time ‚Äî are you buying or browsing?"
- "That [player_item]? I‚Äôll give you [offer_price] and not a coin more."
- "You drive a hard bargain, but‚Ä¶ alright, you‚Äôve got a deal."
```

### üé≤ Word Banks

```python
player_title = ["traveler", "merchant", "stranger", "friend", "scavenger"]
item_type = ["elixirs", "runes", "blades", "curios", "spices"]
region = ["the Eastern Dunes", "Stonebay", "the Rusted Coast", "Crow's Hollow"]
player_item = ["silver dagger", "old map", "phoenix feather", "enchanted ring"]
offer_price = ["20 crowns", "a sack of salt", "half a gem", "a favor"]
```

---

## üíò 2. **Flirting / Charm / Romantic Banter**

### üé≠ Templates

```text
- "You always come back here, [player_title]‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs not just the wine you like?"
- "Careful, keep looking at me like that and I might start believing you."
- "I've seen danger, I've seen death ‚Äî but your smile? That's the real trouble."
- "Tell me something true‚Ä¶ or at least something sweet."
- "Stay a little longer. The night‚Äôs just getting interesting."
```

### üé≤ Word Banks

```python
player_title = ["darling", "troublemaker", "fireheart", "sweet liar"]
flirt_item = ["your smile", "those eyes", "the way you talk", "your voice"]
flirt_place = ["this tavern", "moonlit nights", "quiet mornings", "the firelight"]
```

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è 3. **Fighting / Taunts / Combat Talk**

### üé≠ Templates

```text
- "Come on then, show me what that blade can do!"
- "You‚Äôve got two options: drop the sword, or drop dead."
- "Is that all you‚Äôve got? I‚Äôve fought shadows tougher than you."
- "I've ended bigger threats before breakfast."
- "Draw, or crawl away. I don‚Äôt care which."
```

### üé≤ Word Banks

```python
combat_titles = ["whelp", "dog", "fool", "blade-dancer", "corpse-to-be"]
weapons = ["that dagger", "your fancy stick", "rusty sword", "toy blade"]
combat_styles = ["like a drunk", "like a ghost", "like a butcher", "like a poet"]
```

---

## ü§™ 4. **Fooling Around / Mischief / Trickster Dialog**

### üé≠ Templates

```text
- "Relax, it was only *mostly* cursed. You‚Äôll be fine."
- "Oops. Was that *your* coin pouch?"
- "Don't look at me ‚Äî the goat was on fire *before* I got there."
- "Rules are more like‚Ä¶ guidelines, right?"
- "Let‚Äôs call it a happy little accident. Like your haircut."
```

### üé≤ Word Banks

```python
mischief_objects = ["coin pouch", "magic scroll", "the ale barrel", "your boots"]
mischief_events = ["the goat incident", "last week‚Äôs fire", "that cursed soup"]
tones = ["playful", "mocking", "innocent", "sarcastic"]
```

---

## üß© Combine with Logic (Optional)

You can switch between these dialog types based on context:

```python
if situation == "trading":
    use trading templates
elif situation == "flirting":
    use flirting templates
elif situation == "combat":
    use fighting templates
elif situation == "mischief":
    use fooling around templates
```

Or assign a **personality type** to NPCs that leans them toward certain templates (e.g., ‚Äúgrumpy trader‚Äù, ‚Äúflirty bard‚Äù, ‚Äúchaotic rogue‚Äù).

---

## üß™ Want to See One In Action?

Here‚Äôs a **generated example** from each category:

---

**ü™ô Trading**

> ‚ÄúLooking to trade, scavenger? I've got the finest runes this side of Crow's Hollow.‚Äù

**üíã Flirting**

> ‚ÄúYou always come back here, troublemaker‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs not just the wine you like?‚Äù

**‚öîÔ∏è Fighting**

> ‚ÄúIs that all you‚Äôve got? I‚Äôve fought shadows tougher than you.‚Äù

**ü§° Fooling Around**

> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at me ‚Äî the goat was on fire *before* I got there.‚Äù

---

Would you like all these packed into a Python or JS generator? Or a single file with all templates and slots defined for easy integration?

Ah, {greeting_time}! Didn't expect to see you in {location}, {player_title}.
